                        <p class="text-muted">   The Open Doors Project was inspired by team members’ noticing a growing crisis of identity and direction among their peers, an issue that they observed leading to aimlessness, isolation, and depression—all of these experiences only exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  We feel that addressing this phenomena and seeking out the root of its cause could lead to targeted improvements in the support students are able to find within the education system.  
                        </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">
                                From script development, to casting for participants, to the filming of interviews and video editing, every aspect of our production has been run and realized by a passionate group of roughly two dozen young adults including undergraduate students, high school seniors, and military personnel from across the United States.  While the project is the result of contributions from individuals all over the country, the on-ground filming of our interviews took place in Boston and New York City, each production with localized casting and camera crew teams.  In scouting for participants, we strove for geographic (in addition to other aspects of) diversity among our interviewees, meaning that our participants placed their hometowns in a variety of locations throughout the country.  Between our two studio locations in Boston and New York, a total of 15 interviews were collected and featured in our initial video.  
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">
                                With the perspective that we, and hopefully other viewers, gain from these interviews, we hope to learn and spread a message of how we might best improve the educational system in our country in its support of students and their sense of purpose.

Within the Open Doors Project she has worked on casting for the Finding Purpose in American Education project and she is currently working on creating the Beneath the Surface Podcast–a podcast centered on understanding the intersection between mental health and high school education. In the past, Selorna has worked with National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Stanislaus County and NAMI California and is generally interested in mental health advocacy. At Harvard College, she is part of the Harvard College Chapter of Active Minds, The Harvard Ballet Company, The Harvard Brain Neuroscience Journal, and the Harvard Premedical Society.

Eventually, he plans to delve into neuroscience and become a neurosurgeon. His experience growing up in a rural town of only 600 people has provided him with lived experiences of inaccessible education, mental health treatment, and college preparation. Conner is predominantly working on the Beneath the Surface Podcast, a podcast he hopes will encourage young listeners to reach out for mental health support. In the past, Conner founded a public speaking platform called End the Stigma, where he traveled across the country giving a speech about personal mental health experiences, mental health tips for those who are struggling, and ways we can end the stigma surrounding mental health. At Stanford University, he is part of Stanford RAGE - an organization that works to provide substance abuse and mental health support - and Stanford Mental Health Outreach (SMHO). Outside of his responsibilities, Conner enjoys hanging out with friends, binge watching Netflix and TikTok, and going on spontaneous adventures. </p>

                                <p class="text-muted bios">Producer. Isabella is a member of the Stanford University class of 2025. Her academic focus lies mainly within the fields of psychology and communications, as well as feminist studies, American liberal studies, and art practice. Her work in education first began at Henry M. Gunn High school in Palo Alto, where she co-founded and served as vice president of Gunn’s Hands Off IX Club. Through Hands Off IX, Isabella focused on raising awareness to issues regarding gender inequality and Title IX in Palo Alto schools. She gained hands-on experience conversing with local school board officials and educators; collaborating with other high school and university students; proposing, campaigning for, and passing local Title IX reform; and curating, then releasing information regarding student rights under Title IX through easily digestible forms of media. At Stanford, Isabella has explored the power of art and media to convey messages of importance through, for example, zine-making for social and political activism. She hopes to bring these skills to the Open Doors Project to produce media raising awareness to the inequalities present within the American education system and, in turn, inspire change.
